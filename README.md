# SPDCamerAudioSensor
Notes: 
-	The physical unit has been built and tested. We are currently looking at cooling options to prevent the unit from overheating. The unit consists of a raspberry pi4 a 2- TB hard drive and various hardware for power management.
-	Features: In addition to this being a standard crime camera that can stream and record HD videos, but it also has the option for AI. With AI we can perform gunshot detection, vehicle counting, pedestrian counting, social distancing detection and various other automated process.  
o	Future versions: We will replace the raspberry pi4 with a compute module 4 with a custom PCB board. This will increase the capabilities of the unit while reducing production costs.
-	Cameras: The crime camera can accommodate up to 3 HD cameras. The cameras can be a combination of PTZ 360-degree cameras or standard static cameras. The cameras can be mounted to the unit or spread out over ethernet.
